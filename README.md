# C - printf
This is a project based task that involves a team of 2, to design a custom based `printf` that would work as a secondary `printf` and carry out the same function just like the printf function.

In this project the `printf function` would perform basic operations like carrying ut the format specifier switch as well as being able to display string of text, letters, numbers and characters just like the actual printf.
